#ORIGIN
Three years ago,a new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.
Transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020.
As of 30 January 2020, approximately 8,243 cases have been confirmed.

A totally trend of the confirmed number in 2020 is showed below.
```{r echo=FALSE}
full_grouped %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Date,y=Confirmed,color=`WHO Region`)) +

From this graph,it is clear that COVID-19 began to spread in the world in April of 2020.

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}

```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the clos
1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.

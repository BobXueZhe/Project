Three years ago, a new kind of pneumonia named COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and began to spread in the world. People who caught COVID-19 always have a high temperature or shivering and a continuous cough.

To find the origin of COVID-19, we got the dataset from the Kaggle website. It contains the number of confirmed, death, recovered and active people from January to the end of July in 2020 in different region.

## GLIMPSE OF DATA

To begin with, we made a line plot of confirmed number in 2020 and use color to represent different region in the world, like Europe and Asia. This plot showed us a totally glimpse of the epidemic situation, so that we could find our direction of exploration. In first three months of 2020, COVID-19 did not seen as a serious disease, and majority of patients came from China. So it has not turn to a worldwide illness.

In April, Americas region has recorded plenty of patients and became the hardest-hit area. Meanwhile, the number of patients in all the regions began to increase quickly.So far COVID-19 has become a big problem of the world.

In July, there has been 16480485 confirmed in the world, however, Americas region took up more than a half.
